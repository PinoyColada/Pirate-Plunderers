### ***Description***
#### A project made for CMSC 495, our team "The Bro-Grammers" has made a program that will be a space invader-type game written in JavaScript that will allow the player to control a single unit and fire upon descending enemies that are trying to reach the bottom of the screen. Before starting, the player will enter their player name into a prompt. The player will then have to eliminate all or as many enemies as possible to achieve a score. The score will be stored in a file on the Python Flask backend and will be updated with each game played.
